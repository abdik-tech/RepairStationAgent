udemy course agentic AI
- 16 weeks coding agentic AI from scratch.
- the SDK is cursor
note
- Agent vs workflow
"AI agents are programs where LLM outputs control the workflow"
5 understandings about "agents"
- Multiple LLM calls
- LLMs with ability to use tools
- An environment where LLMs intract
- A planner to coordinate activities
- Autonomy

Agentic System according to Antropic

Workflows - systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths

Agents - systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks

5 workflow design patterns

1. prompt chaining - decompose into fixed sub-tasks
